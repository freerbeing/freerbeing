Cultivation of positive loving feelings towards others works to support us, and others, as we walk our paths towards freedom

It is traditional in Buddhist meditation to finish one's regular meditation with a meditation of the heart:\
This practice is known as **Metta Bhavana**\
In Sanskrit, metta means “love,” “kindness” or “friendliness” and bhavana means “cultivation”, or "focus"\
Patañjali also emphasized the importance of developing loving-kindness

Open your heart outwards and silently repeat the following words\
They do not need to be an exact repetition, it is generating the feeling that counts

- May I be free of all anger, hatred, ill-will, animosity
- May I generate love and compassion, peace and good-will
- May all beings share my peace, my harmony
- May all beings be happy
- May all beings be peaceful
- May all beings become liberated

>**Bhavatu Sarva Mangalam**\
>May all beings be happy
