**Where am I right now?**\
At any point, in order to progress, we are best served
by accepting the reality of our current situation\
We assess where we are and decide what we most need\
This is true for short-term and longer-term goals

**What will serve me best?**\
This enables us to employ the most suitable principles
and techniques for us, giving us support and direction \
We are then well-equipped to orient ourselves towards
where we want to go, and take the most productive,
intelligent and logical steps in that direction,
one step at a time

**Appropriate application**\
Off-the-peg formulas, expecting all practitioners to do
the same thing, every time, is like expecting everyone
to wear the same-sized trousers\
Each individual has their own path and self-practice is
fundamental to ongoing success\
There are however common aspects and landmarks
along the way\
An experienced guide is invaluable
