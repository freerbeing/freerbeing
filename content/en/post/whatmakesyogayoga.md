In the Yoga Sutras Patañjali jumps straight in at the beginning with a definition of Yoga and what it does.
I've picked a few translations and then add my own thoughts

### YS 1:2
**What is Yoga?**

> *"Yoga is the settling of the mind into silence."*
> Alistair Shearer

> *"Complete mastery over the roaming tendencies of the mind is Yoga."*
> Pandit Rajmani Tigunait

> *"The restraint of the modifications of the mind-stuff is Yoga."*
> Swami Satchitananda

> *"Yoga is the containment of movement in the psyche."*
> Paul Harvey

So we can see that Yoga is a mental process and a mental state.
It is a process whereby the mind progressively comes to a clear/calm/contained/tamed/mastered state.
And it is that state of clear/calm/contained/tamed/mastered mind.
**Yoga is both journey and destination.**

Note that there is no mention of the physical postures.

## YS 1:3
**And then ...**

> "When the mind is settled, we are established in our essential nature, which is unbounded consciousness."
> Alistair Shearer

> "Then the Seer becomes established in its essential nature."
> Pandit Rajmani Tigunait

> "Then the Seer [Self] abides in his own nature."
> Swami Satchitananda

> "Then the seer's own character remains."
> Paul Harvey

Then our True Nature, our Deepest Self, is fully and completely present and established.
Our Divinity shines without block or hindrance.
Awareness/*purusha*/soul is established in its true form.
We become/are our True Self.

### YS  1:4
**Otherwise ...**

> "Our essential nature is usually overshadowed by the mind."
> Alistair Shearer

> "Elsewhere [the Seer] conforms to the roaming tendencies of the mind."
> Pandit Rajmani Tigunait

> "At other times [the Self appears to] assume the forms of the modifications."
> Swami Satchitananda

> "At other times there is identification with the movement."
> Paul Harvey

We appear to take on the qualities of the mind/psyche.
We mistakenly identifying ourselves with the passing mind-based phenomena we call our body/thoughts/feelings.
We take the form of the mind.
Our understanding of, and thus our actions in, the world become distorted by mis-perception and misunderstanding.
We are governed by our conditioned thinking and our karma.

### Context

It is important to also appreciate the context in which Patañjali was working.
He does not directly mention the search for deeper truth as this would have been a given.
Anyone coming to learn the principles and techniques of Yoga would have been a seeker and would have taken this assumption for granted.
This is not the case today.
Many people come to Yoga (or simply perhaps that which calls itself 'Yoga' but lacks the criteria that actually make it Yoga) for reasons other than spiritual development.

### Union

Another helpful way to explore this subject is to look at the meaning of the sanskrit word 'Yoga'.
The word comes from the root 'Yuj' meaning 'to yoke', 'to join', 'to unite'.
So a common definition/translation of the word is 'Union'.
From this we can appreciate that Yoga is the practice of union.

**Union of what?**

Yoga works on the basic premise that we are inseparably part of a whole but have come to mistakenly see ourselves as separate.
Yoga works to re-unite our fractured/disconnected false self with the whole.
Thus we become harmonious/coherent/balanced with laws of universe and nature.

Again, this can refer to the process of becoming unified, and also to the desired goal - that of union/wholeness
Yoga is both means and end.

**Conclusion**

What makes Yoga Yoga is the active pursuit of deeper truths of ourselves via internal enquiry by quietening/calming/taming/mastering the mind.
If we are not working to quieten/calm/master the mind in order to progress spiritually we are not practising Yoga.
