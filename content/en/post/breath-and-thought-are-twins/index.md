## Breath and thought are inseparably connected

For example, faster, agitated thinking leads immediately
to faster, agitated breath, whilst slower breathing
quietens the mind

This is a two-way street with which we can work to our benefit

In one direction, by regulating breath, in posture work
(*asana*) or seated breathing exercises (*pranayama*), we
can achieve specific effects in our thoughts\
We can change how we feel, perhaps inhaling to
energise and refresh, or exhaling to calm

Coming at things from the other direction, meditation
calms, quietens and interrupts the ongoing inner flow of
thoughts\
The process is inherently calming to the breath\
Deeper enquiry occurs as breath quiets the mind and
allows more space for pure experience and the
resultant peace and contentment
