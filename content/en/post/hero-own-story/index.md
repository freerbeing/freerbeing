Mythological story-telling is common across all cultures\
Stories from around the globe and from many eras share a fundamental structure, themes and meanings\
Joseph Campbell called this phenomenon the "Monomyth"

Myths from many ages and cultures deal with the spiritual evolution of an individual using archetypes, allegory and symbolism\
From The Odyssey to Star Wars to Sleeping Beauty, from Congo to China, India to Ireland, the hero goes through common archetypal experiences as they achieve their goals

The great variety of symbolism in these stories refers to the universal inner journey towards Deepest Truth and the various landmarks and stages involved in that journey

Stories typically follow a three-stage process, each stage comprising some or all sub-stages:

### The Leaving or Separation

There is a change in the hero's usual mundane life\
 A call to adventure, a trauma, perhaps a supernatural message\
 The hero departs, sometimes reluctantly, their familiar surroundings, and finds themselves fully, inescapably, in a new life, a new world of adventure

### The Initiation

Our hero passes through a number of challenges, trials and tests\
We may see the search for a physical object, such as a Holy Grail, Herculean-type tests of physical or mental strength, traps and pitfalls to overcome, meetings with supernatural beings or gods\
A transformation of some kind comes, such as slaying the dragon, marriage to the princess, or even death and rebirth\
At last they achieve their goal

### The Return

The hero returns to his previous world, but changed, whole, a master of life\
They are free of previous limitations and are qualified to show others the way of the hero

The theory of a Monomyth reveals a method of story-telling that is innate to all cultures depicting the universal evolutionary challenges for all humans as they traverse life\
Every human, whether they are aware of it or not, is on their own hero’s quest\
By studying myths, and enjoying stories, we can better understand the tests and trials of our own life, as we relate to the heroes that have passed along the path before us
