It is interesting to note that although it appears to us that we suck in and push out air as we breathe we do not, in fact, directly control the air\
As the chest expands on inhale, the lungs open up, and the air pressure drops relative to external air pressure
The weight of the air causes the air itself to push itself into the lungs as it seeks to achieve equilibrium of its own volition\
On exhale, the contraction causes the internal air pressure to rise above that of the outside environment, which prompts the air to leave and return to equilibrium

We think we breathe the air\
It is perhaps more accurate to state that the air breathes us

The same is true of prana\
We do not control directly the forces of nature, they are way bigger and stronger than we are\
We create the conditions in our micro environment so that we are in harmony, or not as the case may be, with the macro environment

In such a way a farmer prepares the field for irrigation, setting things to receive rain\ He/she does not create or control the rain which operates on its own rules beyond the control of the farmer
