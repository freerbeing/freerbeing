When we see an athlete warming-up by touching their toes in what we would call a forward bend or *uttanasana* ~ is that Yoga?

Is this Yoga?

Is this?

![](../ims/child.jpg)

Actually, it's a bit of a trick question.
You can't tell just by looking at the form/shape, because that is not what defines Yoga posture as Yoga posture.
So how can we tell?

I would propose that there are two aspects/levels to address in answering this:

1. The motivating intention/goal/destination.

If we are seeking the goals of Yoga and using the principles of Yoga, then we are practising Yoga.
I discuss these goals and principles here: [What Makes Yoga Yoga?]({{< ref "whatmakesyogayoga.md" >}})

So then ... if we are working to achieve Union/Wholeness through clearing/taming the mind, then a particular physical position or exercise may qualify as Yoga.
Given that our intention is such then any posture/exercise must also incorporate the principles following in order to qualify as Yoga.

2. Patañjali's principles of technique.

Patañjali gives us his definition of Yoga posture/**asana**:

### YS 2:46

*sthirasukham*asana*m*

This is an amalgamation of 3 words: *sthira*, *sukha* and **asana**.

Here's some translations;

> "Yoga pose is a steady and comfortable position."
> Mukunda Stiles

> "*Asana* is steadiness and ease."
> Christopher Chapple and Yogi Ananda Viraj

> "The posture is firm and comfortable."
> Frans Moor

> "*Asana* must have the dual qualities of alertness and relaxation."
> TKV Desikachar

*Sthira* is variously described with such words as 'stability', 'strength', 'effort' ... etc.
It is an active, 'masculine' quality.
*Sukha* can be described as 'softness', 'surrender', 'relaxation' ... etc.
It is a passive, 'feminine' quality.

So we can see that Yoga *asana* combines and balances the two qualities of *sthira* and *sukha*.
We can say that *sthira* and *sukha* are both means and ends within a posture.
When we work to establish these two fundamental conditions in our posture then we can call it Yoga, the practice, the journey.
And once we have successfully accomplished the balance of these two defining principles then a posture is mastered and we can call it Yoga, Union, the destination.

In the following two sutras Patañjali goes on to say (using my words and combining the two sutras):
That we should focus on the infinite in us (our Soul/*Purusha*) ... and that then we will come to deeper understandings of the manifest world/universe.

In the 196 verses of the Yoga Sutras, Patañjali only mentions posture/*asana* four times (and once of those is just to say that it exists).
Although, with typical brevity, Patañjali says no more about posture/*asana*, he gives us a great deal of scope to work with.
I will be discussing his recommendations about *asana*, and how we can successfully employ them in our practice, in more detail in future articles.

Can we say then, that any physical exercise, not just the usually-quoted 84 or so, can be called Yoga if we make it so by applying the criteria above.
I think we can.
Patañjali certainly does not say that we cannot, and give no specific instruction on the actual form of any *asana*.

Many of the postures, particularly the standing postures, that we employ today are not old, dating back perhaps some 100 years or so.
Mark Singleton's fascinating book 'Yoga Body' does a great job of examining the origins of modern Yoga postures.

All this is not to say that there are not many valid, 'lesser' goals/aims than Union and *sthira/sukha* on our Yoga posture journey.
There are, of course, many landmarks, pass-throughs and stop-overs, individual to each of us, along the way to the final destination.
For example, we may need to ease this pain, or soothe that dis-ease, or work with any number of potential physical issues in order to make progress.
Bodily issues and difficulties, chronic pain or limited mobility etc, can inhibit our access to Yoga's higher goals and they can be very effectively addressed with appropriate posture practice.

Such issues can also act as sign-posts, revealing hidden aspects of ourselves, and guiding us on our path.
A stiff, painful back, for example, can indicate a deeper emotional or perhaps karmic condition that needs to be addressed.
And that condition can often be effectively addressed, entirely or in part, via appropriate *asana* practice.

**Conclusion.**

The path taken and the ultimate destination are the defining aspects of  any journey and are what give that journey direction, shape and meaning.
In order to be practising Yoga we must, by classical definition, be working towards realisation of our deeper, hidden truths via the process of quietening/mastering of the mind.
That given, a Yoga posture, then, is a Yoga posture when we employ and balance the foundational, defining characteristics of *sthira* and *sukha*.
