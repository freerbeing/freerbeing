Samkhya and Yoga go hand-in-hand
The Samkhya model explains the universe and our place in it
Yoga supports us to experience the realities Samkhya postulates

The name 'Samkhya' is derived from the following words: number, enumeration, reckoning, summing-up, calculation, deliberation, reflection, reason, intellect
It can be seen as meaning something along the lines of 'a collection of numbered lists'
This reflects the fact that the Samkhya breaks down the principles of cosmic evolution into categories using detailed and reasoned, scientific logic

**Brief overview**
One of the six orthodox Vedic philosophies, or *darshana*, of ancient India, Samkhya teaches discriminative knowledge which allows us to understand what we are, by deducing what we are not
It is important to the study of Yoga because Yoga is the practical application of Samkhya
The two darshana are often referred to together as the Samkhya-Yoga school
Where  Samkhya views the universe as a whole, a macrocosm, Yoga uses the same principles to relate to the individual, a microcosm
Samkhya demonstrates that suffering, *dukha*, is caused by ignorance of our true nature, *avidya*
Yoga offers a practical means to the realisation of that true nature
Samkhya explains the universe through reason
Yoga is the practical means (primarily meditative) which leads to the ability to discriminate between that which we are and that which we are not
The goals of both Samkhya and Yoga are the elimination of suffering and the liberation of the soul

The Baghavad Gita acknowledges the two:
> **Baghavad Gita 3:3**
> *"In this world there are two roads of perfection ... Jnana Yoga, the path of wisdom of the Samkhya, and Karma Yoga, the path of action of the Yogis"*
> Translation by Juan Mascaro
